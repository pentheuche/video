While everyone was eagerly counting down the seconds, waiting to ring in the new year, Alex Pereira was cupping his ears, desperately hoping time would grind to a halt and 2024 would never come to an end. It was a stellar twelve months for the current UFC light heavyweight champ, some would say the perfect year.

On Saturday, March 8, at UFC 313, the Brazilian MMA megastar, enters the octagon for the first time in 2025. It will be his fourth defense of the crown at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, and it could prove to be the hardest ring encounter of his life.

Pereira, who's also held the UFC middleweight belt, has successfully defended his title three times, but for much of the past year Ankalaev has been watching, waiting, preparing. After losing his UFC debut, the Russian has reeled off 11 victories and gone unbeaten in 13, and he'll lean heavily on his wrestling game against the seasoned champ.

Since this is an official PPV fight, there isn’t a way to watch UFC 313 online for free. However, the early prelims and prelims stream on Disney+ and ESPN+ for subscribers, while the prelims broadcast on cable networks ESPNEWS on TV — which is available via Fubo, Hulu + Live TV and DirecTV Stream.

However, he faces a much different test today as he takes on renowned grappler Ankalaev. The champion is known for his concussive knockout power that won him kickboxing titles before he made the switch to MMA, but now has to deal with a Dagestani wrestling style.

Meanwhile, both the early prelims and prelims livestream on Disney+ and ESPN+, so it might be worth signing up for Disney Trio for the event.

2024 may have been a dream year for Pereira, but the previous year had started dismally for the man they call 'Poatan.' He suffered heartache at UFC 287 in April 2023, when losing the UFC middleweight belt to Israel Adesanya in their rematch. However, that defeat proved to be a blessing in disguise. Pereira subsequently stepped up to light heavyweight, and he hasn't looked back since, racking up five straight wins in his new division and picking up the title belt along the way.

Justin Gaethje always warrants attention, and tonight the box office fan-favorite will take on Rafael Fiziev in a three-round rematch of their superb UFC 286 tussle. The majority decision went the American's way two years ago, but with both fighters coming off extended layoffs — Gaethje after getting knocked out by Max Holloway last April; Fiziev after suffering a serious knee injury in September 2023 — anything could happen.

After securing wins over Jan Blachowicz and Jiri Prochazka in 2023, Pereira powered past Jamahal Hill, Jiri Prochazka (again), and Khalil Rountree Jr. last year to extend his KO winning streak to 4 fights. Despite that blistering run of form, he won’t be underestimating the challenge that awaits him in Vegas. UFC fans have been crying out for Magomed Ankalaev to take on the champ, and their pleading voices have finally been answered.

inauspicious start for the man from Dagestan, who lost his first-ever bout after tapping out against Paul Craig. He didn’t let the defeat deter him, as he bounced back in style six months later when KO’ing Marcin Prachnio in the first round. That would be the first of Ankalaev’s four career ‘Performance of the Night’ awards, as he’s gone on an impressive 13-fight unbeaten run since losing to Craig.

This won’t be Ankalaev’s first title shot of course. Back in December 2022, he clashed with Jan Blachowicz for the vacant light heavyweight crown. However, that contest ended in a split draw, and annoyingly for the Dagestan man, as he failed to impress the UFC gods in that matchup, he wasn’t given another crack at the belt. Until now that is anyway. Is the challenger going to outfox Pereira with his grappling skills, or will the light heavyweight king power his way to another successful defense of the crown?
