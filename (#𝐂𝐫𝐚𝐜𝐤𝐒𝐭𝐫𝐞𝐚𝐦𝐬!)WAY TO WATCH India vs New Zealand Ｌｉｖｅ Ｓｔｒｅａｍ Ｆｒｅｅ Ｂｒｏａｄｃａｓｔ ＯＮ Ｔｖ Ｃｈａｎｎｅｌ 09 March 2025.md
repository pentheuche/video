Both teams have been in superb form throughout the tournament and now stand on the cusp of securing the coveted title. India, led by Rohit Sharma, boasts a line-up filled with formidable match-winners, while New Zealand, under the leadership of Mitchell Santner, has shown resilience and tactical brilliance.

Champions in 2002 and 2013, India have cruised into the final as they seek to become the first team to win the ICC Champions Trophy three times. Expertly led by captain Rohit Sharma, they won all three group games before securing a four-wicket victory over Australia in the semi-finals.

Virat Kohli was the star in that clash, with his typically composed 84 proving crucial as India chased down Australia’s target of 265 with 11 balls to spare. The legendary batsman has amassed 261 runs in the tournament and will be a prized wicket in the final.

New Zealand were equally impressive in their semi-final as the secured a thumping 50-run victory over South Africa. Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson both scored centuries, while Matt Henry grabbed two wickets to take his total to 10 for the tournament.

Although he was dismissed cheaply in the group match against India, Ravindra continues to pose a threat, one that India will hope Pandya’s experienced pace and bounce will counter – as he did in the group match.

This final promises to be a cracker of a contest, with both teams having the perfect blend of experienced players and emerging stars. India made their way to the final with a dominant display in the group stages, topping Group A and defeating Australia by 4 wickets in the semi-final, thanks to a crucial knock from Virat Kohli.

Henry has been superb throughout the competition and returned impressive figures of 5-42 against India in the group stage. However, that was not enough to secure the victory as India eased to a 44-run win.

The 2025 ICC Champions Trophy final is finally here. India and New Zealand have looked like the most likely candidates to make it to this stage from the outset of this electric competition. India have won every game on their journey to this final. New Zealand have only lost once (to India), and they looked incredibly impressive in their semi-final win over South Africa.

New Zealand, on the other hand, secured their place in the final by defeating South Africa by 50 runs in their semi-final. Rachin Ravindra was the star, scoring an impressive century, and his efforts helped New Zealand maintain their unbeaten run in the tournament. Both teams have earned their spot in the finale through grit, skill, and determination, and now it’s down to the final battle for glory.

This time around, however, India have swept past the Aussies in the semifinal and are now standing face to face with New Zealand, who smashed South Africa in the other semifinal after scoring the highest ever team total in Champions Trophy history. Another similarity that India’s 2023 run and the current run is that India will face a team they have already defeated in the group stage.
