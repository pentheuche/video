It's time to watch AEW Revolution 2025 live streams today as this latest All Elite Wrestling PPV follows in the footsteps of December's solid Worlds End. Having retained the AEW World Championship against Orange Cassidy, 'Hangman' Adam Page and 'Switchblade' Jay White at Worlds End, Jon Moxley now has to fend off the challenge of Cope in Los Angeles.

AEW’s Revolution 2025 is shaping up to be one of the most explosive events in professional wrestling history. Set to take place at the iconic Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Sunday, March 9, the pay-per-view promises to deliver a night of unforgettable action, featuring high-stakes title matches, bitter rivalries, and career-defining moments.

Emanating from Los Angeles' Crypto.com Arena, AEW Revolution 2025 has the potential to be one of the best wrestling events of the entire year by the time all is said and done.

Broadcasting live from Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena, AEW Revolution 2025 is shaping up to be a show-stealer, packed with high-stakes battles and potential showstoppers. The main card currently features eight scheduled bouts, though given AEW's penchant for last-minute additions, more clashes could be on the horizon before the PPV kicks off. With five championship matches and plenty of simmering feuds set to explode, the stage is set for a memorable night.

At the top of the bill, Cope steps up to challenge Jon Moxley for the AEW World Championship. This time around, it looks like Mox's Death Riders allies won’t be lurking at ringside, setting the stage for a true one-on-one showdown. Could that swing the odds in favor of the former Edge, allowing him to walk away as AEW's new top dog? Then again, with Christian Cage holding a guaranteed title shot, the Patriarchy leader could strike at any moment, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the night’s main event.

Writing with absolutely no hyperbole what-so-ever, All Elite Wrestling President and CEO Tony Khan has booked 3-4 matches that could end up being serious 'Match of the Year' candidates. Including, but not limited to, Will Ospreay and Kyle Fletcher inside of a Steel Cage, Kenny Omega challenging Konosuke Takeshita for the International Championship, and Mercedes Moné battling Momo Watanabe with the TBS Championship on the line.

In the expected Revolution main event, Jon Moxley defends his AEW World Championship against 11-time former World Champion and WWE Hall of Famer Cope. While that match is likely to close AEW Revolution 2025, even more anticipated is the Falls Count Anymore war between AEW Women's Champion 'Timeless' Toni Storm and heated rival Mariah May. On top of those huge matches, a further three titles are on the line, not to mention several extremely personal issues coming to the fore.

Then there's tonight's triple main event slate that will crown a new No. 1 Contender for the AEW World Championship and potentially two new AEW World Champions.

The AEW Women's Championship will also be on the line as 'Timeless' Toni Storm and Mariah May clash once more, this time in a Falls Count Anywhere match. With both competitors having dominated the division for over a year, this Hollywood-inspired showdown could mark the end of their long-running rivalry—but the big question remains: who will leave with the gold?

Elsewhere, the TBS Championship sees Mercedes Moné defending against Momo Watanabe, while Konosuke Takeshita puts his International Championship on the line against Kenny Omega in what promises to be a high-octane encounter. Meanwhile, The Hurt Syndicate's Bobby Lashley & Shelton Benjamin will look to hold onto their AEW Tag Team Championships as they go toe-to-toe with the ever-entertaining duo of Truth Magnum & Turbo Floyd, better known as The Outrunners.

The Rated R Superstar Adam Copeland last held a World Championship 14 years ago. He could finally end that drought and rescue the AEW World Title from the Death Riders when he faces off against Jon Moxley tonight. This is a match that will be anything but pretty, in the best way possible.

Timeless Toni Storm and Mariah May will battle for the AEW Women's Championship in what many AEW faithful believe should be the main event. Fans have soaked in every emotional moment of their story the last several months and tonight will witness their Hollywood Ending.

While the remaining matches may not have championship stakes attached, they carry plenty of weight in terms of pride, personal grudges, and the all-important battle for supremacy. AEW Revolution 2025 is poised to deliver fireworks, with every competitor eager to steal the show.
